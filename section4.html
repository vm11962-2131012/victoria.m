        <h2>Mars Odyssey</h2>
    
        In 2001 the Mars Odyssey began to Orbit Mars and thanks to scientific and tehcnological advancements NASA was able to retreive spatial data of Mars' surface wihch was never seen by austronauts before. With the help of GIS, which is used for geographic Earth analysis, the mapping of exoplanets and other celestial bodies. This was made achieveable due to the abilities of converting data and images from rovers and sattelites into spatial data. <br>

        <h4>THEMIS (Thermal Emission Imaging System)</h4>
        The THEMIS was a camera placed by NASA on the Odyssey to help map the surface of Mars as well as its thermal energy that is not visible to the human eye. With the THEMIS scientists were then able to draft a strikingly similar model of Mars and its geologic activity.
